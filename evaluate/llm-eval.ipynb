       " 'input': \"<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>You are a public servant. Your task is to reply to a parliamentary question given a list of supporting points.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\nQuestion:Mr Leong Mun Wai asked the Prime Minister (a) since the conclusion of the 2023 Presidential Election, how many non-voters have applied to restore their names to the Registers of Electors; and (b) how many of these applications are successful.\\n\\nSupporting points: **Title: Applications to Restore Names to Registers of Electors**\\n\\n**Executive Summary:**\\n\\nAs of the end of January 2024, a total of 101,464 non-voters from the 2023 Presidential Election have successfully applied to restore their names to the Registers of Electors. This report details the background, process, and implications of these applications, with a focus on ensuring continued electoral engagement and upholding democratic principles.\\n\\n**Background:**\\n\\nThe 2023 Presidential Election saw a significant number of eligible voters abstaining from casting their votes. Consequently, their names were removed from the Registers of Electors in accordance with established electoral regulations. However, recognizing the importance of inclusive participation in democratic processes, the Elections Department provided a mechanism for non-voters to restore their names to the registers.\\n\\n**Application Process:**\\n\\nThe process to restore names to the Registers of Electors was designed to be straightforward and accessible. Non-voters could submit their applications through various channels, including:\\n1. **Online Portal:** A dedicated section on the Elections Department's website allowed individuals to complete and submit their applications electronically.\\n2. **In-Person Submissions:** Local electoral offices across the country were equipped to handle in-person applications, ensuring access for individuals without reliable internet access.\\n3. **Mail-In Applications:** For added convenience, applicants could also restore their names via postal mail by sending completed forms to their respective electoral offices.\\n\\n**Volume of Applications:**\\n\\nBy the end of January 2024, a total of 101,464 individuals had applied to have their names restored. This significant number reflects a robust response from the public, underscoring the desire among citizens to re-engage with the electoral process. The breakdown of applications received through different channels is as follows:\\n- **Online Portal:** 67,892 applications\\n- **In-Person Submissions:** 22,710 applications\\n- **Mail-In Applications:** 10,862 applications\\n\\n**Approval and Verification:**\\n\\nAll 101,464 applications were meticulously reviewed by the Elections Department. The verification process ensured that each applicant met the criteria for restoration, including:\\n- **Verification of Identity:** Confirming the identity of applicants to prevent fraudulent submissions.\\n- **Eligibility Check:** Ensuring that applicants were eligible voters in the 2023 Presidential Election and had not been disqualified for other reasons.\\n- **Data Accuracy:** Cross-referencing application details with existing records to maintain the integrity of the Registers of Electors.\\n\\nUpon successful verification, all applications were approved, and the names of the applicants were restored to the Registers of Electors. This meticulous approach guarantees the reliability and accuracy of the electoral registers.\\n\\n**Implications:**\\n\\nThe successful restoration of 101,464 names to the Registers of Electors has several significant implications:\\n1. **Enhanced Voter Engagement:** The substantial number of restored names reflects a renewed commitment among citizens to participate in future elections, thereby strengthening democratic engagement.\\n2. **Inclusivity:** The accessible application process ensured that individuals from diverse backgrounds had the opportunity to restore their names, promoting inclusivity in the electoral process.\\n3. **Administrative Efficiency:** The Elections Department's efficient handling of the applications demonstrates its capability to manage large volumes of requests while maintaining accuracy and integrity.\\n4. **Public Trust:** The transparent and successful restoration process fosters public trust in the electoral system, reinforcing the legitimacy of future elections.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n\\nThe successful restoration of 101,464 names to the Registers of Electors is a testament to the commitment of both the Elections Department and the citizens to uphold democratic values. The robust response from non-voters highlights the importance of accessible and inclusive electoral processes. Moving forward, continued efforts to engage and educate the electorate will be crucial in maintaining a vibrant and participatory democracy.\\n\\n**Recommendations:**\\n\\nTo build on this success, the following recommendations are proposed:\\n1. **Ongoing Public Awareness Campaigns:** Continuously educate the public on the importance of voting and the process for restoring names to the Registers of Electors.\\n2. **Enhanced Accessibility:** Further streamline the application process, particularly for online submissions, to accommodate an even broader segment of the population.\\n3. **Regular Updates:** Periodically update the public on the status of the Registers of Electors and any changes to the application process.\\n4. **Feedback Mechanism:** Implement a feedback mechanism to gather insights from applicants on their experience, enabling continuous improvement of the process.\\n\\nBy implementing these recommendations, we can ensure that the electoral system remains robust, inclusive, and reflective of the will of the people.\\n\\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\"}"
