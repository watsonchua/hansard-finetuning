      "Q:\t Mr Christopher de Souza asked the Minister for Health how is Singapore collaborating with the global scientific community to create a COVID-19 vaccine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A:\t Apart from vaccine development, Singapore has also been involved in the research and development of therapeutics to improve the treatment of COVID-19 patients. For example, the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and public hospitals are participating in multi-national clinical trials involving the experimental drug, Remdesivir, which has shown to improve the recovery of COVID-19 patients in some studies.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Q:\t Mr Chong Kee Hiong asked the Minister for Manpower (a) what is the progress of the Tripartite Advisory on reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities; (b) what is the target date for the advisory to be ready; (c) whether the Ministry will consider including the advisory's guidelines as part of the Workplace Fairness Legislation; and (d) how will the Ministry measure whether a reasonable accommodation has been implemented effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A:\t The contents of the advisory will not be a part of the Workplace Fairness Legislation. Instead, the advisory will complement the new law, which will prohibit workplace discrimination on the basis of disability. Both the advisory and upcoming law will work alongside the Enabling Masterplan to strengthen employment opportunities for persons with disabilities. \n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Q:\t Dr Tan Wu Meng asked the Prime Minister (a) since 2020, how many reports are received by financial institutions or MAS regarding unauthorised PayNow transactions involving consumer banking accounts; (b) what proportion of the cases has the mechanism of unauthorised transaction been established; (c) how do such unauthorised transactions take place; (d) what is the total amount of the unauthorised fund transfers reported and recovered respectively; (e) what are the respective median amounts per affected consumer; and (f) what is being done to better protect consumers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A:\t  Consumers need to stay vigilant and remember a few basic rules – one, do not provide your digital banking credentials to anyone under any circumstances; two, do not click on links purportedly sent by banks, as banks will not send you links in SMS or emails; three, use the banks' official mobile applications for your banking needs to minimise the risk of navigating to fraudulent websites.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A:\t The Government plans to employ a combination of funding methods to finance these measures. This includes funding from the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund, through long-term borrowing via SINGA bonds and through the use of past Reserves to fund land reclamation costs. The Government will continue to study how best to finance these measures in a way that is fiscally sustainable and equitable across generations.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "Q:\t Mr Kwek Hian Chuan Henry asked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether the Ministry will allow households which are unable to fully utilise their GST U-Save vouchers to withdraw the balance for supporting their other living expenses.\n",

      "\n",
      "A:\t  The Government has also introduced support measures to help Singaporeans defray other living expenses. These include the CDC Vouchers in January, the Cost-of-Living Special Payment in June, the GSTV – Cash in August and the Assurance Package Cash in December.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
